• This field should be set to "MET" or "NOT_MET" by an OM when a new student submits a cume folder, according to the status of WA State History on a student's transcript.
• The other update of this field will be periodic mass updates of students who passed the 3 WA History Challenge Focus Areas on the Platform. This is managed by Data & Ops by sending a list of "MET" students to Illuminate Help.

* Description:
*  This query produces a list of students who repeated grades. Repeating grades is defined by having
*  the same grade level on two or more different enrollments in different academic years.
*
* How it works:
* The "distinct_ay_grades" CTE pulls one grade-academic year record for each student and filters out duplicate rows where
* students left and came back in the same grade level in the same academic year.
* The "count_doubles"  CTE creates a number count of records for each student in "distinct_ay_grades". Note here that the count
* is ordered by academic year descending so in your final pull academic year is going to indicate the year in which the student
* was selected to be retained NOT the student's second academic year in the same grade.
* The "repeaters" CTE filters out any student who did not repeat a grade.
* In the main select statement, you can bring in addition information you want to know about the repeater student group.

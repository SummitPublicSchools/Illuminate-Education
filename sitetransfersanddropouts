 /*
 This query pulls students who exited a Summmit school for a reason besides graduating and did not return
 to the same school the following academic year

 HOW TO USE:
  Modify academic year, following academic year and site ID
  For example, if you wanted to see how many students left Rainier in 2016-2017 then
  side ID = 1 (line 42 and line 70)
  academic year = 2017 (line 68)
  following academic year = 2018 (line 40)


 SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS:
  - Change exit code key to narrow search to non-disciplinary reasons
  - Remove following_year_enrolled filter to include those intending to transfer at the end of the year
  - Remove site from "following_year_enrolled" to exclude students who stayed in the Summit Network (just switched sites)

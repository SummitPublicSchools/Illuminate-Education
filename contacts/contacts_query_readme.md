## Contacts Query Starter
The query in the file `contact_info_starter-long_or_wide.sql` can be used as the starter for any query where current contact information is needed. Here are some things to know:
* The parts of the query that you need to modify don't start until near the bottom. There is a message that says where you should edit and where you should not.
* Depending on how you do the final query, this query can return contact information in long or wide form. There is a note in the query around line 407 that tells how to do this.
* It will not work out the box if we needed to query historical information (e.g. addresses of dwellings a household use to reside at). By design, this query pulls a row of information for each contact with their most recent information.
